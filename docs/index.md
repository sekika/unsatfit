# unsatfit

unsatfit is a Python library for optimizing parameters of functions of soil hydraulic properties (water retention function and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function). It was developed to write the following paper, and unsatfit determined the parameters of hydraulic properties and drew figures in this paper.
