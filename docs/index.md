# unsatfit

unsatfit is a Python library for optimizing parameters of functions of soil hydraulic properties (water retention function and hydraulic conductivity function) where equations are explained in the following paper.

The proposed equations are useful for practical applications as shown in the following paper.

## History ([Detailed version](history.md))

- 2007-02-27: [SWRC Fit](https://seki.webmasters.gr.jp/swrc/) started to run on the web.
- 2021-08-13: SWRC Fit was recommended at [土壌の物理性](https://doi.org/10.34467/jssoilphysics.148.0_45).
- 2021-11-24: A [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.20168) written with unsatfit was published at VZJ.
- 2022-01-04: Relased unsatfit 4.0, including a new version of SWRC Fit.
- 2023-01-06: Released the [UNSODA viewer](https://sekika.github.io/unsoda/), a web app that displays data from [UNSODA 2.0](https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1173246). For each dataset, water retention data is linked directly to SWRC Fit for model fitting.
- 2023-02-04: A [paper](https://doi.org/10.2478/johh-2022-0039) introducing unsatfit was published in JHH.
- 2024-10-20: Received the **JSSP award** ([土壌物理学会賞](https://js-soilphysics.com/prz)) from the Japanese Society of Soil Physics for the [paper of dual-VG fitting](https://doi.org/10.34467/jssoilphysics.155.0_35). A [summary report](https://doi.org/10.34467/jssoilphysics.159.0_103) was subsequently published in Japanese.
- 2024-11-13: Presented a [poster](https://researchmap.jp/sekik/presentations/48434771/attachment_file.pdf) on hysteresis and [hystfit](https://sekika.github.io/hystfit/) at [ASA, CSSA, SSSA meeting](https://researchmap.jp/sekik/presentations/48434771); took a [photo with Rien van Genuchten](https://sekika.github.io/toyo/photos/RVG.html).
