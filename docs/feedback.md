# Feedback
Please direct any questions to the [Q&A category on the unsatfit Discussions page](https://github.com/sekika/unsatfit/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=). To do so, create a GitHub account, sign in, and click the green "New discussion" button. I will respond via comments. It is recommended to ask your questions publicly in this manner, as others with similar queries can benefit from the answers found online. If your message is not a question but rather feedback or information you wish to share with the author and users of unsatfit, please use the [General category](https://github.com/sekika/unsatfit/discussions/categories/general).

However, if your query involves confidential information, such as unpublished data, please reach out to me via email. My email address can be found in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.20168).
